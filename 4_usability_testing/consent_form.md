# CONSENT FORM

## Usability testing



## Our Consent form 

Below is a copy of our teams consent form. We chose to personalise some of the questions so particpents were aware of the process and that they may be asked to give further elaboration on any statements made during usability testing. The form will be given to each user particpent prior to conducting userability testing to confirm we have their full consent.
