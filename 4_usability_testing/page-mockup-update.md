# Page mock up update
Below shows the updated version of our page mock up, which encorporates changes made after user testing on the origional page mock up in SP3.

The changes include adding a discussion forum to the page, adding a time frame to discounts to encourage them to be utilised, adding links to the blog pages at the footer of every page on the site, and encouraging various clothes for all genders to be displayed on the home page. 

However, some work was out of scope. In this case, despite a lot of international users making use of our guide, it was hard and too complex to encorporate different languages into the site, and so we had to stick with English across the guide.
