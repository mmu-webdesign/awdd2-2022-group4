## Persona One

### Ella Jackson
Ella is a full- time uni student with a part time job. She was derived from our user research as we interviewed several different students and the most common students found to be at the university were there full time and often had part- time jobs that they did on the side. We thought this would be the most realistic demographic to portray an everyday student. However, Ella does have a language barrier. We wanted to produce a a guide that was as inclusive as possible, and some of the students we interviewed did have language barriers, thus we thought this would be the most appropriate way of building an inclusive site.

## Persona Two

### Jason Brown
Jason is a Degree Apprentice who commutes to university. He was derived from our research as we wanted to include different types of students that may not necessarily live in the Manchester area and so may have different fashion styles and backgrounds. For example, a degree apprentice works full- time and studies part- time so they often have to wear a smarter style throughout the week. This will be reflected in the guide to fashion.

## Persona Three

### Dr Jackson
Dr Jackson was derived from out research as we interviewed a couple of tutors to see what they thought about our idea for a guide to fashion. Lecturers spend alot of time with their students, and can often tell if they feel left out or sad one day. There are also a high number of lecturers at the uni so it is important to include them in the demographic to produce a realistic representation of university. By encouraging lecturers to suggest a guide to fashion as a platform to promote inclusivity, it could help word about the site get around and offer free promotion for us.
