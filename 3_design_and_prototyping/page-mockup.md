# Design process and high fidelity page mock up

As a team we each created a page design independently , and when finished we discussed our ideas with one another. By borrowing each others ideas, we were able to come up with our final design which we believe to be the best solution. 

The following designs are Low-fi designs that we created on pen and paper. We designed them as if they were on a mobile first and included colour ideas, layout, typography, space, form and considered usability and accessibility.

You should add evidence of your groupâ€™s design process here. Begin with artefacts created by the whole team, then the high fidelity mockup.

## Group Artefacts

After we initially created our designs on pen and paper, we moved to a web based platform to create a more realistic design. We were able to consider the layout and space, as well as using colours and fonts specifically mentioned in our style guide.
