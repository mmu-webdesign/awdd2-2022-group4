# Design process and high fidelity page mock up

As a team we each created a page design independently , and when finished we discussed our ideas with one another. By borrowing each others ideas, we were able to come up with our final design which we believe to be the best solution. 

You should add evidence of your groupâ€™s design process here. Begin with artefacts created by the whole team, then the high fidelity mockup.

## Group Artefacts

After we initially created our designs on pen and paper, we moved to a web based platform to create a more realistic design. We were able to consider the layout and space, as well as using colours and fonts specifically mentioned in our style guide. 

Please add at least one artefact per group member related to the exploration of designs for your website.

## High Fidelity mock-up

This is our final design which encourporates ideas from each member of the group which has resulted in a higher quality site. 

Add a screenshot of a single high fidelity mock up of one important page of your site, including all global elements (e.g. navigation and page footer).
