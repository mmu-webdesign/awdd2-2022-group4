            Don't forget, every web font adds to the weight of your page.

                <p>The wily fox jumped over the lazy dog. </p>
                <p class="why">This typeface is used for the Navigation pane. We chose it because it is a clear font, that supports different weights of text as required.</p>

                <p class="why">This typeface is used for links. We chose it because it came up as a very popular font for luxury clothing brands so we thought it would stand us in good sted, and present to our users a feeling of quality and knowledge of the clothing we are recommending.</p>

                <p class="why">This typeface is as a general fallback font that can be used in the event that the Google fonts are not available. We chose it because it is a font that is always available and is natively installed</p>

            <h2>User interface</h2>
            <p>You can use this area to create items like call to action buttons or other user interface elements that you will re-use throughout your site (lists, maps, etc). An example is below.</p>
            <h3>Buttons</h3>
            <div><a class="button important" href="#">Click me, I am important</a><a class="button normal" href="#">Click me, I am useful</a>

                <p>
                    These links can be used within the Footer section of the website for smaller accessibility related options, as well as any duplicate links
                </p>
            <a class="link less" href="#">Click me if you need to</a></div>

        <!-- You should be creating your own imagery because that's what we expect on your finished site. If you use images from other websites as a way of briefing other group members, PLEASE CREDIT THE ORIGINAL PHOTOGRAPHER/WEBSITE.  -->
        <section>
            <h2>Imagery</h2>
            <p>To encourage consistency add examples of imagery <strong>your group has created</strong> so that everyone can see them. You might also add photoshopping instructions or other relevant details.</p>
            <div class="images">

                <div class="image">
                    <img src="img/buzzlogov2.png" alt="Logo for group" width="300" height="110" />
                    <p>This is the logo for BUZZ. It should not be used any smaller than 150px by 120 px. There are no intentions for a smaller logo</p>
                </div>

                <div class="image">
                    <img src="img/logodmv1.png" alt="Logo for group" width="103" height="110" />
                    <p>This is a logo to be used on a dark mode version of the website. While the dark mode is a stretch target, this can be used to support the general simpler design style for those pages. As with the normal logo, it should not be used any smaller than 150px by 120px.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="image">
                    <img src="img/test1.jpg" alt="test image" width="600" height="400" />
                    <p>This image demonstrates the main two colours we hope to encorporate into our guide. The contrast between the colours helps to draw attention to different areas of the site making it user friendly. The colours also have connotations of a bee which is often associated with Manchester and also reflects our logo and name of our site (which is 'BUZZ'). You create it by layering yellow and black striped to create contrast. We also searched for similar images on various playforms such as pinterest to gather inspiration. </p>

                <div class="image">
                    <img src="img/test2.jpg" alt="test image" width="600" height="400" />
                    <p>This image demonstrates some of the architectural elements of Manchester. This is something we are hoping to include in our guide as it would help us to identifiy with the potential users of the site, especially since the majority of them are students and will likely be living in Manchester themselves. You create it by searching for specific buildings and architectural designs in Manchester on platforms such as pinterest and google images, or by walking through the city and taking picyures first hand. </p>
