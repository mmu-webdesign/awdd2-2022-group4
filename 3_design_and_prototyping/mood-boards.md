My personal influences for this mood board include having local imaged of Manchester included on the site. I think this creates a more relatable site and it makes it clearer as to what the site is about, especially as it is specifically targeted at students in Manchester. After searching around, I gathered inspirations from looking at other websites and how them presented their sites to encourage more sales. I noticed that presenting the different style pieces together as one outfit helped to promote sales of multiple items rather than just one. I noticed this predominantly in magazines targeted to a student age range. This is something I would like to include on our site. Furthermore, many student sites I looked at had bold colours. For example, Unidays makes use of bright green colour, and so I looked at other bold colours to include such as blue and pink which could help attract students to the site and help emphasise specific parts of the site which may include discounts or deals.

My Personal influences and inspirations for this mood board involve having barnding that resnoates with the the culture of Manchester. I believe it is important to incorporate Manchester icons, such as the bee, and Manchester colour schemes such as yellow and dark red. However, I am aware that we are trying to promote a product and we are a site that hosts numerous brands, each with their own unique branding. Therefore, I believe it is important to make the branding minimalist to allow for the individual local brands to shine. I noticed that this was a technique used by many big fashion brands, who pick an accent colour and a easy to read font that showcases the product itself. This is were I have drawn inspriation on my mood board, which has explored Manchester branding, common colour schemes, typography and what is the common branding trends for fashion websites. I believe the best approach for our websites branding would be to have small Manchetser specific elements whilst using an overal minimalistic theme to allow us to create a website that is easy to naviagte and looks appealing to students.
