## Moodboard One

### Adele Le Moignan
My personal influences for this mood board include having local imaged of Manchester included on the site. I think this creates a more relatable site and it makes it clearer as to what the site is about, especially as it is specifically targeted at students in Manchester. After searching around, I gathered inspirations from looking at other websites and how them presented their sites to encourage more sales. I noticed that presenting the different style pieces together as one outfit helped to promote sales of multiple items rather than just one. I noticed this predominantly in magazines targeted to a student age range. This is something I would like to include on our site. Furthermore, many student sites I looked at had bold colours. For example, Unidays makes use of bright green colour, and so I looked at other bold colours to include such as blue and pink which could help attract students to the site and help emphasise specific parts of the site which may include discounts or deals.
