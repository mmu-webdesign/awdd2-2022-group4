### Notes

The main issues that arose after testing our webpage in google chrome was that the page was not evenly spread out enought to fill the device in which it was presented on. As you can see above, when the website was displayed in google chrome it was all situated in the top left corner of the page. This creates a very uninspiring page, and the lack of pictures or any form of imagery further contributes to this. However, the page is fully functional and all of the links to the different areas of the site work well.
Provide a description of any issues. If the issue has to be corrected add another screenshot to show the fix.

### Google Chrome Fix 
We revisited the code on this site to try and improve it for the browser of google chrome. We managed to add pictures to the page to make it more engaging and interactive for users of the site. Furthermore, after fixing the code the page now displays perfectly on a computer screen, and fills the page rather than being bunched in the top left corner of the screen. This makes it much more usable.
