## Speed test (inc. optimisation of code and media)

Download speeds. Are there any _blockers_. Are images optimised?
[SolarWinds pingdom](https://tools.pingdom.com/) has been used to complete a general website speedtest.  Load time listed as 751ms with connections to London and Germany (Frankfurt). There was a suggestion to include <expires>, however as this is a fairly lightweight website, this is currently seen as out of scope.

All Images included on the website have gone through file compression, with the average decrease around 64%

## Readability testing

Test at least some of your text. Think of your type of users and the levels they would expect.

Also test your grammar and spelling as this will lose you credibility (**and marks**).

## SEO

Review your metadata (Checkbot will help) including page titles, meta description, link text, use of headings, use of keywords in your text.
